Solution: 
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int t, n;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--)
    {
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n);
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        int count_one=0, count_zero=0; 
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            if(a[i]==0) count_zero++;
            else count_one++;
        }
        cout << min(count_one, count_zero) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

Explanation: If we get the minimum of 0 and 1 it means we are getting a pair of 1 and 0 that has the ability to produce maximum sum. But others will appear most time and as a result the score will get decreased
